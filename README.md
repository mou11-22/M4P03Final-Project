# M4P03Final-Project
Gender Equality Analysis using World Bank Data
Overview
--------
This project explores global gender equality trends using data from the World Bank's Gender Statistics.
Through data cleaning, exploratory visualizations, and analysis, we aim to identify patterns and disparities in
gender-related indicators across countries and time.
Tools & Technologies
--------------------
- Python
- pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook
Dataset
-------
- Source: World Bank Gender Statistics
- File Used: Gender_StatsEXCEL.xlsx
- The dataset contains country-level indicators related to gender equality such as literacy rate, employment,
health metrics, and more.
Data Cleaning
-------------
- Removed rows and columns with all null values.
- Dropped duplicate entries.
- Previewed and filtered relevant indicators for analysis.
Visualization
-------------
Visual explorations included:
- Bar plots of selected indicators by country.
- Trendlines of indicators over time.
- Heatmaps to understand missing data and correlations.
Analysis & Insights
-------------------
Key insights include:
- Literacy rates and labor participation by gender.
- Health and education gaps across countries.
- Regional patterns in gender equality.
How to Run
----------
1. Clone this repository.
2. Install the required libraries:
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn openpyxl
3. Place the dataset file (Gender_StatsEXCEL.xlsx) in the appropriate directory.
4. Open and run the notebook final project Mou.ipynb using Jupyter.
Future Improvements
-------------------
- Create interactive dashboards using Plotly or Dash.
- Include statistical tests or machine learning models for deeper insights.
- Expand to a broader set of years or regions.
